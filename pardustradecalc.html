                <h1>Pardus Own Building Ticks</h1>
                <p>
                On buildings - Overview, adds a couple of columns to show what
                your buildings need to reach 4 and 6 ticks worth of upkeep
                stock. Say your building needs 4 food/tick, and has 14 food. So
                this will show 2 and 6 food in the 4-tick and 6-tick columns.
