            This is the home page of the <a href="http://www.pardus.at/">Pardus</a> auto-mapper.
            </p>
            <p>
            The automapper is a map tool for the 
            <a href="http://www.pardus.at/">Pardus</a> game. 
            It is a Firefox
            extension that you run while navigating around the
            game.
            It automatically picks up a snapshot of the nav screen
            (and nothing else, honest, look at the code) and sends it to this
            server, where we generate nice maps and lists:
            </p>
            <p>
            Orion:
            <a href="/pardusmapper/maps/orion/sectors.html">Sector list</a>
            <a href="/pardusmapper/maps/orion/universe.html">Universe map</a>
            <a href="/pardusmapper/maps/orion/locations.html">SBs and planets</a>
            <br/>
            Artemis:
            <a href="/pardusmapper/maps/artemis/sectors.html">Sector list</a>
            <a href="/pardusmapper/maps/artemis/universe.html">Universe map</a>
            <a href="/pardusmapper/maps/artemis/locations.html">SBs and planets</a>
            <br/>
            Pegasus:
            <a href="/pardusmapper/maps/pegasus/sectors.html">Sector list</a>
            <a href="/pardusmapper/maps/pegasus/universe.html">Universe map</a>
            <a href="/pardusmapper/maps/pegasus/locations.html">SBs and planets</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            <a href="/pardusmapper/fcgi/planets.pl">Planet stats</a>
            </p>

            <p>
            You have to turn it on, and you can turn it off -- so no one else
            can see what's in your faction's secret nook, for example. Be
            aware, once a screen is in here it stays here.
            </p>

            <p>
            It only runs on a fairly new version of Firefox at this time.
            </p>

            <p>
            The extension: <a href="pardusajaxautomapper.xpi">Pardus Ajax Automapper</a>
            </p>


            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>To install, activate the link (above) in Firefox. Firefox should do the rest.</p>
            <p>Sorry, the extension does NOT work with Internet Explorer or any
            other browser, as far as we know. Nor do we care. If you get it to
            work, great! If you send us instructions on how to get it to work,
            great, we'll post them!</p>
            <p>
            You should have a new option in the Tools menu.
            </p>
            <p>When you click it to start, it pops up a message: Starting
            Pardus Automapper. When you stop it, it pops up a message: Stopping
            Pardus Automapper, and a number. Don't worry about the number, it's
            just the number of nav screen snapshots that were left to send.</p>
            <p>
            The maps on this site are automatically updated every 15 minutes
            based on data received from players using the extension.
            </p>
            <p>
            The maps have a route calculator feature. Select the
            type of engine, and then click your starting point, and then click
            your ending point. It will attempt to calculate the least-cost
            route. It ignores the presence of monsters.
            </p>

            <h2>Props</h2>
            <p>
            Props to "Pants Commander" (don't ask me) whose work 
            <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/darmani/">Darmani</a> extended,
            whose work we extended. They did the automapper, we optimised it
            and made it report to a server instead of a file. Much work on the
            server side to produce the maps and images. Many man-hours of
            programming in Perl. And Javascript. Props to Larry Wall too.
            </p>

            <p>
            Props also to 
            <a href="http://www.thebluesuncorporation.com/">Blue Sun
                Corporation</a>, who helped and inspired all map-makers and
            whose universe coordinates we have borrowed. Their <a
                href="http://www.thebluesuncorporation.com/pardusmap/">Pardus
                map</a> helped us a lot in our exploration of Pardus.
            </p>

            <p>
            Props to members of T.I.R.O. who patiently listened to our ranting
            and raving as we programmed the back-end scripts and the
            route-finder function. T.I.R.O. also helped with valuable testing
            and contributed much of the initial maps here.
            </p>

            <p>
            Props to 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra">Edsger Dijkstra</a>
            for the 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm">least-cost-routing algorithm</a>. 
            Also to 
            <a href="http://www.nasaexplores.com/">NASA Explores</a>,
            for the PDF which told us how to calculate a path from known
            distances.
            Also to 
            <a href="http://www.cs.usask.ca/resources/tutorials/csconcepts/1999_8/tutorial/advanced/dijkstra/dijk_descrip.html">some tutorial at some Canadian university</a> for furthering our understanding of Dijkstra's algorithm.
            </p>

            <p>
            Props to Piotr Rorot for the idea of, and showing me example code
            for, the funky sector selection list on the universe map pages.
            </p>

            <p>
            And of course, to the <a href="http://www.pardus.at/">Pardus</a> programmers!
            </p>

            <p>With the new Aperture, thanks to Takius Stargazer, Lancel,
            Nebulosa, Stewb, Bishop, Lysin, Tovarisch Kapitan, 
            and others unnamed, for
            sector locations.</p>

            <p>
            No thanks whatsoever to the griefers.
            </p>
