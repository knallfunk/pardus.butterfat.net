            <p>
            Once you load it up, you should get a text box, a couple buttons,
            and a drop-down on the left. First, type in a name for the course
            and then click the "lay in course" button. Follow the route you
            want in Pardus, within a sector. Wormhole jumps are not supported
            yet. At the end, click the "finish course" button.  </p>
            <p>
            Now the course you laid in should show up the in drop-down box.
            When you're on the tile you started on, click the "Engage" button
            and it will give you an "autopilot step" button, click the button
            at each step along the route.
            </p>
            <p> You can have as many
            routes as you want, but each route will be within a single sector.
            Wormhole jumps are not supported (yet).
            </p>

            TODO: Ability to reset the memory, maybe
            ability to save and share courses (you can copy the lines from
            user.js or about:config, so this won't be done). Multi-sector
            autopilot
            ability.
